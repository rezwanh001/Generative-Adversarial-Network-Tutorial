# Generative Adversarial Networks Tutorial: 
> This is a blog on Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs). This is invented by *Dr. Ian Goodfellow*. This blog has been wiritten on the basis of *Dr. Ian Goodfellow*'s and his book name is *Deep Learning*

----------------------------------------------

   **Q1. Why study generative models?**
   
   *Ans:*
        
   * Excellent test of our ability to use high-dimensional, complicated probability distributions.
   * Simulate posible future for plannig or simulated Reinforcement Learning(RL).
   * Missing data
      * Semi-supervised learning.
   * Multi modal outputs
   * Realisic generation tasks.i.e., generation of images or audio waveforms as the actual specification of the tasks itself and these clearly require generative modeling intrinsically.
